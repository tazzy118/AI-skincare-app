<h1>AI Skincare Application 1st ClassðŸ”¬ðŸ§´</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I developed an AI-powered skincare detection system designed to improve accuracy and fairness in dermatological analysis, particularly for melanin-rich skin tones, which are often underrepresented in AI models. The application uses YOLOv11 for image classification, OpenCV CLAHE for contrast enhancement, and Flask for backend processing, ensuring efficient detection of skin conditions such as acne and eczema while maintaining secure data handling. To enhance inclusivity, I incorporated bias mitigation techniques and ethical AI principles, aligning with BCS and ACM standards as well as GDPR compliance to promote fair and transparent AI decision-making. Awarded a First-Class with 74 percent, this project showcases expertise in machine learning, image processing, and full stack development, demonstrating its potential for real world AI solutions in dermatology.
